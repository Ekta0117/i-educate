        not computers. When first building this generator we thought about using
        computers to generate the paragraphs, but they weren't very good and
        many times didn't make any sense at all. We therefore took the time to
        create paragraphs specifically for this generator to make it the best
        that we could.No! All of the paragraphs in the generator are written by
        humans, not computers.
